## Sequential Advancement of Topics

- **Git and GitHub**

  Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. Git is known for its speed, flexibility, and robust branching and merging capabilities.

  GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting and managing Git repositories. It provides a collaborative environment for software developers to work together on projects, manage source code, and facilitate version control. GitHub is widely used for open-source and private software development.

- **HTML**

  HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure and content of a web page by using a system of elements and tags. HTML is the backbone of web development and is essential for displaying content in web browsers. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

  - Form

    Created a layout for a basic form with different input types.

- **CSS**

  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and formatting of web documents written in HTML and XML. CSS allows web developers to control the layout, appearance, and design of web pages, making it a fundamental technology for web design.

  - Form

    Added styling to the previously created form.

  - Time-Table

    Created a personal dummy timetable with HTML and added CSS.

- **JavaScript**

  JavaScript is a versatile, high-level, and widely-used programming language primarily known for its role in web development. It allows developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites and web applications. JavaScript has also found application in various other domains, including server-side programming, mobile app development, and desktop applications.

- **ES6**

  ECMAScript is the standardization of Javascript which was released in 2015 and subsequently renamed as ECMAScript 2015. ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a major update to the JavaScript language specification. It introduced many new features and enhancements to the language, making JavaScript more powerful and expressive.

- **MySQL**

  MySQL is an open-source relational database management system we can interact with using SQL â€“ Structured Query Language.

- **NodeJS**

  Node. js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. It allows developers to build server-side applications and network applications using JavaScript. Node.js is built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, and it's known for its speed and scalability.

- **MongoDB**

  MongoDB is an open-source, NoSQL database management system that provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing, querying, and managing data. It is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data and is known for its ease of use and scalability. MongoDB's BSON format is similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), making it easy for developers to work with data.

- **TypeScript**

  TypeScript is an open-source, strongly typed, high-level programming language that builds upon and extends JavaScript. It transpiles to JavaScript and is designed to help developers write more robust and maintainable code by adding static typing and other features.

## Projects

- **HTML-CSS-JS-Project**

  Added validation to the previously created form.

- **BasicJSProject**

  Created a basic project to append an element containing user input to a coloured box, depending on the button clicked by the user.

- **BasicNodeJS**

  Created various API endpoints and provided a basic backend logic with sequelize for database operations.

- **QuizManager**
